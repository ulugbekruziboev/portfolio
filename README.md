  Since I am not able to show any projects from my past and current jobs because of the nondisclosure character of the data in it, I decided to artificially create a meaningful dataset based on the jobs I have applied for so far to be able to show at least a small part of my skills and demonstrate my coding abilities.

You may look through the code here or download it in order to run it locally.
The file in IPYNB format can easily be opened within GitHub to inspect it and get initial impression.
The HTML files need to be downloaded in order to see the Bokeh interactive plots (try to click on them with your mouse).
