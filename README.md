# portfolio
  Since I am not able to show any projects from my past and current jobs because of the nondisclosure character of the data in it, I decided to artificially create a meaningful dataset based on the jobs I have applied for so far to be able to show at least a small part of my skills and demonstrate my coding abilities.

You may look through the code here or download it in order to run it locally.
The file in IPYNB format can easily be opened within GitHub to inspect it and get initial impression.
The HTML files need to be downloaded in order to see the Bokeh interactive plots (try to click on them with your mouse).

Instructions to Jupyter notebook users:
1. Download the dataset - job_search_dataset.csv - and put it into your working directory.
2. Download the working file - Ulugbek_Ruziboev_portfolio.ipynb - and put it into your working directory.
3. Launch the file from 2nd step in Jupyter Notebook and run all of the cells.
4. You can inspect the results both inline and Bokeh plots which would automatically open in new windows.

Instructions to PyCharm (or any other Python compiler) users:
1. Download the dataset - job_search_dataset.csv - and put it into your working directory.
2. Download the working file - Ulugbek_Ruziboev_portfolio.ipy - and put it into your working directory.
3. Launch the file from 2nd step in Jupyter Notebook and run the code.
4. You can inspect the results both inline and Bokeh plots which would automatically open in new windows.
